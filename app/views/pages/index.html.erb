        <p>My background is in editing and copywriting, and I'm currently finishing up coding school while juggling two jobs. I work with a math curriculum-writing company, editing their HTML, and also write technical product copy for a large internet retailer.</p>

        <p>After taking several coding courses, working with custom databases, and teaching basic programming concepts to kids, I decided to attend Actualize to pursue a career in coding. I'm excited to be joining such a dynamic field and look forward to finding my first development job!</p>
