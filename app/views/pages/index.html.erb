            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>MeetMe is a scheduling app that allows users to select several meeting times their invitees can vote on, making it easier to arrange a meeting or an event for a group of people and potentially increasing invitee turnout.</p><br>

            <p>My background is in editing and copywriting, and I'm currently working as a web developer for The Difference Engine while juggling two jobs. I work with a math curriculum-writing company, editing their HTML, and also write technical product copy for a large internet retailer.</p><br>

            <p>After taking several coding courses, working with custom databases, and teaching basic programming concepts to kids, I decided to attend Actualize to pursue a career in web development. I'm excited to be joining such a dynamic field and look forward to finding my first development role!</p><br>
